.. _pyfun-json-RunMatrix:

------------------------
RunMatrix or Run Matrix
------------------------

A required section of :file:`pyFun.json` describes the variables that define
the run conditions and the values of those variables.  In many cases, these will
be familiar input variables like Mach number, angle of attack, and sideslip
angle; but in other cases they will require additional description within the
:file:`pyFun.json` file.  The generic run matrix description is found in the
:ref:`Cape RunMatrix section <cape-json-RunMatrix>`.

The default list of keys is *mach*, *alpha*, *beta*, *Re*, *T*.
