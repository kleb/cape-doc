CAPE: Computational Aerosciences Productivity & Execution

Here is a link to a recording of a NASA Advanced Modeling & Simulation seminar
that announced the release of CAPE 1.0.0

https://www.nas.nasa.gov/pubs/ams/2023/03-09-23.html

CAPE has two main purposes:

1. To execute and post-process three different Computational Fluid Dynamics
(CFD) solvers:

    A. Cart3D
    B. FUN3D
    C. OVERFLOW
    D. Kestrel (CAPE 1.1+)

2. Create and use "datakits" a combination of database and toolkit. These are
   data structures particularly well-suited to databases created from
   aerosciences data.

This package has been used by NASA teams to create large databases (in some
instances including over 10,000 CFD solutions) for flight programs such as
Space Launch System.

The main benefit of using CAPE for CFD run matrices is having a single tool to
do many of the steps:

    * create separate folders for each CFD case,
    * copy files and make any modifications such as setting flight conditions
      in input files,
    * submit jobs to high-performance computing scheduling system such as PBS,
    * monitor the status of those jobs,
    * create PDF reports of results from one or more solutions,
    * extract data and conduct other post-processing,
    * archive (and unarchive, if necessary) solution files.

This software is released under the :ref:`license`. While the software is
freely available to everyone, user registration is *requested* by emailing the
author(s).

Installation
--------------

The simplest method to install CAPE is to use ``pip``:

:Linux/MacOS:

    .. code-block:: console

        $ python3 -m pip install git+https://github.com/nasa/cape.git#egg=cape

:Windows:

    .. code-block:: console

        $ py -m pip install git+https://github.com/nasa/cape.git#egg=cape

**Notes**:

    1.  On Windows (where CAPE might be of limited use), replace ``python3``
        with ``py``
    2.  It's also possible to install from one of the provided ``.whl`` files.
    3.  In many cases, adding ``--user`` to the above command is appropriate;
        on systems where you are not a root/admin user, such is likely
        required.
    4.  If installing a new version of CAPE where one might already be present,
        add the option ``--upgrade``.
