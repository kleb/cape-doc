Sweep Conditions Table Subfigure
--------------------------------
The ``"SweepConditions"`` subfigure class, which is only available for sweeps
(i.e. cannot be included in reports for individual cases), shows the list of
constraints that define a sweep. It creates a three-column table with the first
column the name of the variable, the second column the value of the variable
(i.e. trajectory key or derived key such as ``k%10``) for the first case in the
sweep, and the third column a description of the constraint. The constraint
description is either ``=``, meaning that all cases in the sweep have the same
value for that variable, or ``Â±tol`` if all the cases in the sweep are
constrained to be within a tolerance *tol* of the first point in the sweep.
