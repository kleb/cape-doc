Examples Using pyCart
=====================

Example projects that demonstrate how to use pyCart can be found in
``$PYCART/examples/pycart/`` where ``$PYCART`` is the folder in which pyCart or
Cape is installed.  The examples are intended to roughly increase in capability
in an interactive fashion to initiate users to the various capabilities of
pyCart and Cart3D.

The first two examples are designed to initiate users to basic usage that is
relevant to any pyCart project, and the remaining examples try to introduce more
complex features one at a time.  As a result, the examples after the first two
are fairly independent.  One exception is the :ref:`business jet example
<demo-pycart-bJet>`, which discusses how to use the ``"DataBook"`` and
``"Report"`` sections.
