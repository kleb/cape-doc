Changelog
********************


Release 1.0.4
====================
The test suite now runs with three Python versions: Python 2.7, 3.6, and 3.11.
We also found a way to create wheels with the ``_cape2`` or ``_cape3``
extension module in more Python versions.

Bugs Fixed
------------

*   Allow spaces in strings when reading tab-delimited files using ``DataKit``
    or ``TextDataFile``.
*   Fix some ``matplotlib`` imports to work with more ``matplotlib`` versions.
*   Switch order of ``CaseFunction()`` hook and ``WriteCaseJSON()`` in
    ``cape.pycart`` so that ``case.json`` reflects options changes from all
    hooks.


Release 1.0.3
====================


Features added
---------------

*   Add ``"Config"`` > ``"KeepTemplateComponents"`` for pyfun, which tells
    pyfun to add components to the ``'component_parameters'`` section rather
    than replacing it.
*   Support FUN3D 14.0 (a change to the STDOUT used to measure progress
    in ``pyfun``)

Bugs fixed
-----------

*   Properly tests if ``grid.i.tri`` is already present using ``usurp`` for
    ``pyover --ll``
*   Raise an exception if component list not found during ``py{x} --ll``
    (previously wrote invalid triload input files and ecnountered an error
    later)


Release 1.0.2.post1
====================

Bugs fixed
------------

*   Restore previous support for dictionaries like

    .. code-block:: python

        {
            "sampling_parameters": {
                "plane_center(1:3, 2)": [0.0, 1.0, 0.0],
                "label(2)": "plane-y1",
            }
        }

    as inputs to :mod:`cape.filecntl.namelist.Namelist.ApplyDict`. This is
    related to GitHub issues #4 and #19.

Release 1.0.2
====================

Features added
--------------

*   Add ``"PostShellCmds"`` to ``"RunControl"`` for :mod:`cape.pyover`;
    allows users to add a list of commands that run after every call to
    OVERFLOW
*   Support more recent versions of ``aero.csh`` in :mod:`cape.pycart`
*   Add command-line options to ``py{x} --report``:

    --report RP
        Update report named *RP* (default: first report in JSON file)

    --report RP --force
        Update report and ignore cache for all subfigures

    --report RP --no-compile
        Create images for a report but don't compile into PDF

    --report RP --rm
        Delete existing caches of report subfigure images instead of
        creating them

*   Add support for commas within strings in DataBooks and run matrices
*   Add ``"A"`` option in ``"PBS"`` section
*   Allow ``nodet_mpi`` to set ``"nProc"`` automatically with Slurm
*   Add options ``"YLim"``, ``"YMin"``, ``"YMax"``, ``"YLimMin"`` and likewise
    for ``"PlotCoeff"`` subfigures.

    - ``"YLim"``: list of explicit min and explicit max to use for *y*-axis
    - ``"YMin"``: explicit min to use for *y*-axis
    - ``"YMax"``: explicit max to use for *y*-axis
    - ``"YLimMax"``: outer bounds for *ymin* and *ymax*; CAPE will not plot a
      *y*-value below ``YLimMax[0]`` but may have a min *y*-axis value greater
      than that, and CAPE will not plot a *y*-value above ``YLimMax[1]``. Also
      supports using None (in Python) or null (in JSON) to use one of the
      bounds. E.g. ``"YLimMax": [0.0, null]`` will guarantee only positive
      *y*-values are shown but not set an upper bound.
    - The same options, replacing ``Y`` with ``X``


Release 1.0.1
====================

Features added
---------------

*   Warm-start capability for :mod:`cape.pyfun`, adds options *WarmStart* and
    *WarmStartDir* to ``"RunControl"``  section

Behavior changes
--------------------

*   Use :func:`os.mkdir` instead of :func:`cape.cfdx.options.Options.mkdir`
    during archiving (affects resulting file permissions of new folders)
*   Write binary (``lr4``) instead of ASCII ``.triq`` files when using *it_avg*
    in :mod:`cape.pycart`; speeds up ``pycart --ll`` significantly
*   Allow users to write PNG or JPG files during ``--report`` commands w/o also
    creating PDFs; also ability to include PNG or JPG into compiled report

Bug fixes
----------

*   Better control of force & moment requests in :mod:`cape.pycart`
*   Fix bug in reading some OVERFLOW iterative residual histories
*   Support columns with all ``np.nan`` in
    :func:`cape.attdb.rdb.DataKit.write_csv`
*   Allow adding two :mod:`cape.pycart.dataBook.CaseFM` instances with
    different iteration counts
